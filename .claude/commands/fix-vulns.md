description: Fix npm security vulnerabilities across all packages
---

Use the npm-audit-fixer agent to systematically fix npm security vulnerabilities across the entire project.

IMPORTANT: Only run `npm audit fix` for safe, non-breaking changes. If vulnerabilities remain that require `--force`, stop and ask me for permission before proceeding with any breaking changes.
