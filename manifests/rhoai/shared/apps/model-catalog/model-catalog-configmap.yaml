This model can be used to create LAB models via InstructLab.\n\n### Method\n\nLAB: **L**arge-scale **A**lignment for chat**B**ots is a novel synthetic data-based alignment tuning method for LLMs from IBM Research. Granite-7b-starter is a Granite-7b-base derivative model for training with the LAB methodology, using Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct as a teacher model.\n\nLAB consists of three key components:\n\n1. Taxonomy-driven data curation process\n2. Large-scale synthetic data generator\n3. Two-phased-training with replay buffers\n\nLAB approach allows for adding new knowledge and skills, in an incremental fashion, to an already pre-trained model without suffering from catastrophic forgetting.\n\nTaxonomy is a tree of seed examples that are used to prompt a teacher model to generate synthetic data. Taxonomy allows the data curator or the model designer to easily specify a diverse set of the knowledge-domains and skills that they would like to include in their LLM. At a high level, these can be categorized into three high-level bins - knowledge, foundational skills, and compositional skills. The leaf nodes of the taxonomy are tasks associated with one or more seed examples.\n\nDuring the synthetic data generation, **unlike previous approaches where seed examples are uniformly drawn from the entire pool (i.e. self-instruct), we use the taxonomy to drive the sampling process**: For each knowledge/skill, we only use the local examples within the leaf node as seeds to prompt the teacher model.\nThis makes the teacher model better exploit the task distributions defined by the local examples of each node and the diversity in the taxonomy itself ensures the entire generation covers a wide range of tasks, as illustrated below. In turns, this allows for using Mixtral 8x7B as the teacher model for generation while performing very competitively with models such as ORCA-2, WizardLM, and Zephyr Beta that rely on synthetic data generated by much larger and capable models like GPT-4.\n\nFor adding new domain-specific knowledge, we provide an external knowledge source (document) and prompt the model to generate questions and answers based on the document.\nFoundational skills such as reasoning and compositional skills such as creative writing are generated through in-context learning using the seed examples from the taxonomy. \n\nAdditionally, to ensure the data is high-quality and safe, we employ steps to check the questions and answers to ensure that they are grounded and safe. This is done using the same teacher model that generated the data. \n\nOur training consists of two major phases: knowledge tuning and skills tuning. \nThere are two steps in knowledge tuning where the first step learns simple knowledge (short samples) and the second step learns complicated knowledge (longer samples).\nThe second step uses replay a replay buffer with data from the first step.\nBoth foundational skills and compositional skills are learned during the skills tuning phases, where a replay buffer of data from the knowledge phase is used.\nImportantly, we use a set of hyper-parameters for training that are very different from standard small-scale supervised fine-training: larger batch size and carefully optimized learning rate and scheduler.\n\n## Model description\n- **Model Name**: Granite-7b-starter\n- **Language(s):** Primarily English\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Base model:** [ibm/granite-7b-base](https://huggingface.co/ibm/granite-7b-base)\n- **Teacher Model:** [mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1)\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```python\nsys_prompt = \"I am, Red HatÂ® Starter Model based on Granite 7B, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research, based on the Granite-7b-base language model.

Granite-8b-lab-v1 is a Granite-3.0-8b-base derivative model trained with the LAB methodology, using Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct as a teacher model.\n\nLAB consists of three key components:\n\n1. Taxonomy-driven data curation process\n2. Large-scale synthetic data generator\n3. Two-phased-training with replay buffers\n\nLAB approach allows for adding new knowledge and skills, in an incremental fashion, to an already pre-trained model without suffering from catastrophic forgetting.\n\nTaxonomy is a tree of seed examples that are used to prompt a teacher model to generate synthetic data. Taxonomy allows the data curator or the model designer to easily specify a diverse set of the knowledge-domains and skills that they would like to include in their LLM. At a high level, these can be categorized into three high-level bins - knowledge, foundational skills, and compositional skills. The leaf nodes of the taxonomy are tasks associated with one or more seed examples.\n\nDuring the synthetic data generation, **unlike previous approaches where seed examples are uniformly drawn from the entire pool (i.e. self-instruct), we use the taxonomy to drive the sampling process**: For each knowledge/skill, we only use the local examples within the leaf node as seeds to prompt the teacher model.\nThis makes the teacher model better exploit the task distributions defined by the local examples of each node and the diversity in the taxonomy itself ensures the entire generation covers a wide range of tasks, as illustrated below. In turns, this allows for using Mixtral 8x7B as the teacher model for generation while performing very competitively with models such as ORCA-2, WizardLM, and Zephyr Beta that rely on synthetic data generated by much larger and capable models like GPT-4.\n\nFor adding new domain-specific knowledge, we provide an external knowledge source (document) and prompt the model to generate questions and answers based on the document.\nFoundational skills such as reasoning and compositional skills such as creative writing are generated through in-context learning using the seed examples from the taxonomy. \n\nAdditionally, to ensure the data is high-quality and safe, we employ steps to check the questions and answers to ensure that they are grounded and safe. This is done using the same teacher model that generated the data. \n\nOur training consists of two major phases: knowledge tuning and skills tuning. \nThere are two steps in knowledge tuning where the first step learns simple knowledge (short samples) and the second step learns complicated knowledge (longer samples).\nThe second step uses replay a replay buffer with data from the first step.\nBoth foundational skills and compositional skills are learned during the skills tuning phases, where a replay buffer of data from the knowledge phase is used.\nImportantly, we use a set of hyper-parameters for training that are very different from standard small-scale supervised fine-training: larger batch size and carefully optimized learning rate and scheduler.\n\n## Model description\n- **Model Name**: Granite-8b-lab-v1\n- **Language(s):** Primarily English\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Base model:** [ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-base](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-base)\n- **Teacher Model:** [mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1)\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```python\nsys_prompt = \"I am a Red HatÂ® Instruct Model, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research based on the granite-3.0-8b-base model.

Granite-8b-lab-v1 is a Granite-3.0-8b-base derivative model trained with the LAB methodology, using Mixtral-8x7b-Instruct as a teacher model.\n\nLAB consists of three key components:\n\n1. Taxonomy-driven data curation process\n2. Large-scale synthetic data generator\n3. Two-phased-training with replay buffers\n\nLAB approach allows for adding new knowledge and skills, in an incremental fashion, to an already pre-trained model without suffering from catastrophic forgetting.\n\nTaxonomy is a tree of seed examples that are used to prompt a teacher model to generate synthetic data. Taxonomy allows the data curator or the model designer to easily specify a diverse set of the knowledge-domains and skills that they would like to include in their LLM. At a high level, these can be categorized into three high-level bins - knowledge, foundational skills, and compositional skills. The leaf nodes of the taxonomy are tasks associated with one or more seed examples.\n\nDuring the synthetic data generation, **unlike previous approaches where seed examples are uniformly drawn from the entire pool (i.e. self-instruct), we use the taxonomy to drive the sampling process**: For each knowledge/skill, we only use the local examples within the leaf node as seeds to prompt the teacher model.\nThis makes the teacher model better exploit the task distributions defined by the local examples of each node and the diversity in the taxonomy itself ensures the entire generation covers a wide range of tasks, as illustrated below. In turns, this allows for using Mixtral 8x7B as the teacher model for generation while performing very competitively with models such as ORCA-2, WizardLM, and Zephyr Beta that rely on synthetic data generated by much larger and capable models like GPT-4.\n\nFor adding new domain-specific knowledge, we provide an external knowledge source (document) and prompt the model to generate questions and answers based on the document.\nFoundational skills such as reasoning and compositional skills such as creative writing are generated through in-context learning using the seed examples from the taxonomy. \n\nAdditionally, to ensure the data is high-quality and safe, we employ steps to check the questions and answers to ensure that they are grounded and safe. This is done using the same teacher model that generated the data. \n\nOur training consists of two major phases: knowledge tuning and skills tuning. \nThere are two steps in knowledge tuning where the first step learns simple knowledge (short samples) and the second step learns complicated knowledge (longer samples).\nThe second step uses replay a replay buffer with data from the first step.\nBoth foundational skills and compositional skills are learned during the skills tuning phases, where a replay buffer of data from the knowledge phase is used.\nImportantly, we use a set of hyper-parameters for training that are very different from standard small-scale supervised fine-training: larger batch size and carefully optimized learning rate and scheduler.\n\n## Model description\n- **Model Name**: Granite-8b-lab-v1\n- **Language(s):** Primarily English\n- **License:** Apache 2.0\n- **Base model:** [ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-base](https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-3.0-8b-base)\n- **Teacher Model:** [mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1)\n\n## Prompt Template\n\n```python\nsys_prompt = \"I am a Red HatÂ® Instruct Model, an AI language model developed by Red Hat and IBM Research based on the granite-3.0-8b-base model. My primary role is to serve as a chat assistant.\"\n\nprompt = f'<|system|>\\n{sys_prompt}\\n<|user|>\\n{inputs}\\n<|assistant|>\\n'\nstop_token = '<|endoftext|>'\n```\n\nWe advise utilizing the system prompt employed during the model's training for optimal inference performance, as there could be performance variations based on the provided instructions. \n\n\n**Bias, Risks, and Limitations**\n\nGranite-8b-lab-v1 is a base model and has not undergone any safety alignment, there it may produce problematic outputs. In the absence of adequate safeguards and RLHF, there exists a risk of malicious utilization of these models for generating disinformation or harmful content. Caution is urged against complete reliance on a specific language model for crucial decisions or impactful information, as preventing these models from fabricating content is not straightforward. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether smaller models might exhibit increased susceptibility to hallucination in ungrounded generation scenarios due to their reduced sizes and memorization capacities. This aspect is currently an active area of research, and we anticipate more rigorous exploration, comprehension, and mitigations in this domain.",

From CommitPackFT dataset, we only consider data for 92 programming languages. Our inclusion criteria boils down to selecting programming languages common across CommitPackFT and the 116 languages that we considered to pretrain the code-base model (*Granite-8B-Code-Base*).\n* Math Datasets: We consider two high-quality math datasets, [MathInstruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/TIGER-Lab/MathInstruct) and [MetaMathQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/meta-math/MetaMathQA). Due to license issues, we filtered out GSM8K-RFT and Camel-Math from MathInstruct dataset.\n* Code Instruction Datasets: We use [Glaive-Code-Assistant-v3](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-code-assistant-v3), [Glaive-Function-Calling-v2](https://huggingface.co/datasets/glaiveai/glaive-function-calling-v2), [NL2SQL11](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bugdaryan/sql-create-context-instruction) and a small collection of synthetic API calling datasets.\n* Language Instruction Datasets: We include high-quality datasets such as [HelpSteer](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/HelpSteer) and an open license-filtered version of [Platypus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/garage-bAInd/Open-Platypus). We also include a collection of hardcoded prompts to ensure our model generates correct outputs given inquiries about its name or developers.\n\n## Infrastructure\nWe train the Granite Code models using two of IBM's super computing clusters, namely Vela and Blue Vela, both outfitted with NVIDIA A100 and H100 GPUs respectively. These clusters provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for training our models over thousands of GPUs.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\nGranite code instruct models are primarily finetuned using instruction-response pairs across a specific set of programming languages. Thus, their performance may be limited with out-of-domain programming languages. In this situation, it is beneficial providing few-shot examples to steer the model's output. Moreover, developers should perform safety testing and target-specific tuning before deploying these models on critical applications. The model also inherits ethical considerations and limitations from its base model.

We filter raw data to retain a list of 116 programming languages. After language filtering, we also filter out low-quality code.\n- **Exact and Fuzzy Deduplication:** We adopt an aggressive deduplication strategy that includes both exact and fuzzy deduplication to remove documents having (near) identical code content.\n- **HAP, PII, Malware Filtering:** We apply a HAP content filter that reduces models' likelihood of generating hateful, abusive, or profane language. We also make sure to redact Personally Identifiable Information (PII) by replacing PII content (e.g., names, email addresses, keys, passwords) with corresponding tokens (e.g., â¨NAMEâ©, â¨EMAILâ©, â¨KEYâ©, â¨PASSWORDâ©). Moreover, we scan all datasets using [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) to identify and remove instances of malware in the source code.\n- **Natural Language Datasets:** In addition to collecting code data for model training, we curate several publicly available high-quality natural language datasets to improve models' proficiency in language understanding and mathematical reasoning.

These clusters provide a scalable and efficient infrastructure for training our models over thousands of GPUs.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\nThe use of Large Language Models involves risks and ethical considerations people must be aware of. Regarding code generation, caution is urged against complete reliance on specific code models for crucial decisions or impactful information as the generated code is not guaranteed to work as intended. **Granite-8B-Code-Base-4K** model is not the exception in this regard. Even though this model is suited for multiple code-related tasks, it has not undergone any safety alignment, there it may produce problematic outputs. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether smaller models might exhibit increased susceptibility to hallucination in generation scenarios by copying source code verbatim from the training dataset due to their reduced sizes and memorization capacities. This aspect is currently an active area of research, and we anticipate more rigorous exploration, comprehension, and mitigations in this domain. Regarding ethics, a latent risk associated with all Large Language Models is their malicious utilization. We urge the community to use **Granite-8B-Code-Base-4K** model with ethical intentions and in a responsible way.",
