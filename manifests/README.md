# Manifests

The Dashboard manifests run on Kustomize. There are 3 types of deployments for the Dashboard component.

- Open Data Hub ([`./odh`](./odh))
- Red Hat OpenShift AI
  - RHOAI Managed ([`./rhoai/addon`](./rhoai/addon))
  - RHOAI Self Managed ([`./rhoai/onprem`](./rhoai/onprem))

Each deployment type will have a `params.env` file where the Operator can inject values for us to use.

## The "How" Of Manifests

A common inquiry from the developers working on the Dashboard repo is "how" do these manifests impact installations and what happens during the varying states the given Dashboard component on a cluster goes through; eg. Upgrades, fresh installations, and how does it all work.

A couple key points to get out of the way first:
1. There are multiple "types" of manifest files (specifics can be found in [this ADR](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/architecture-decision-records/blob/main/architecture-decision-records/operator/ODH-ADR-Operator-0008-resources-lifecycle.md))
    * **Unmanaged** (Rare) -- An "install once" mentality; gets onto a cluster but after that it's a user-resource (never to be managed by us again)
    * **Fully Managed** (Very Common) -- Part of the ecosystem of the Dashboard; upgrades, user-changes, and effectively anything you do to the resources on the cluster should result in the Operator setting it back to what is in the manifest file -- this is the most desired state for most of our manifests
    * **Partially Managed** (Rare) -- Some resources (like the [Dashboard Deployment](./core-bases/base/deployment.yaml)) can have some fields modified (like replica count or resource requests/limits) but the rest falls under the managed state -- this is handled as internal Operator logic and not something we typically have any control over
2. The entirety of the `manifests` folder is not installed _ever_ -- a subset of it is based on which "deployment type" you choose

With those said, the key takeaways from this section are:
* The `manifests` folder speaks more to how we show up on a cluster -- not how we update with it
* There are some **Unmanaged** resources that need to be treated very softly as once a customer has it installed, we need external help to address it
    * Dashboard team does not have a mechanism inside our wheelhouse to update an **Unmanaged** file; the Operator team has an upgrade script that needs to be involved if we have critical changes needed
    * The [RHOAI OdhDashboardConfig](./rhoai/shared/odhdashboardconfig/README.md) is the most common friction point
* Currently, there is no way to provide both a user-managed & upgradable resource within Dashboard

## Adding/Modifying Manifests

Rules for keeping the manifest files in a sane order:

1. When adding a new type of thing, always make it have its own folder; be sure to add the reference to the parent folder's `kustomziation.yaml` (if applicable)
2. When adding to a preexisting folder, be sure to add it to the root `kustomization.yaml` in that folder
3. Do not reference "a file" (has an extension) inside another folder. Reference other folders, which will pick up the `kustomization.yaml` inside that folder; those `kustomization.yaml` files should reference sibling files
4. Folders matter -- see the README in each for more details

## Installation (ODH)

You can use the `kustomize` tool to process the manifest for the `oc apply` command.

```markdown
# Set the namespace in the manifest where you want to deploy the dashboard
kustomize edit set namespace <DESTINATION NAMESPACE>
kustomize build common | oc apply -f -
kustomize build core-bases/base | oc apply -f -
```

Alternatively, you can use the `./install/deploy.sh` which uses the `overlays/dev` overlay to select specific folders.

## Testing Changes

One way to test changes locally is to generate the full structure before your changes, and then again after your changes.

Before:
```markdown
# Generate the files before your changes for a baseline
kustomize build rhoai/addon > before-rhoai-addon-test.yaml
kustomize build rhoai/onprem > before-rhoai-onprem-test.yaml
kustomize build odh > before-odh-test.yaml
```

After:
```markdown
# Generate the files after your changes
kustomize build rhoai/addon > after-rhoai-addon-test.yaml
kustomize build rhoai/onprem > after-rhoai-onprem-test.yaml
kustomize build odh > after-odh-test.yaml

# Generate the diff between the two
git diff --no-index before-rhoai-addon-test.yaml after-rhoai-addon-test.yaml > output-rhoai-addon.diff
git diff --no-index before-rhoai-onprem-test.yaml after-rhoai-onprem-test.yaml > output-rhoai-onprem.diff
git diff --no-index before-odh-test.yaml after-odh-test.yaml > output-odh.diff
```

Viewing the diffs will help you understand what changed.
