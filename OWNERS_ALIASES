## Common conventions for this file
##
## - @opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard-owners is added to each approver group
##     - Has all the Admins of the repo
##     - This allows future no_parent_owners to have backups if absences
##     - Avoid removing this group so absences can always be worked through
## - @opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard-maintainers is added to each reviewer group (by default)
##     - Has all the primary Dashboard developers
##     - This allows a default of any reviewer for any PR (only helps with bot auto-reviewer selection)
##     - You can change this to be a subset if you wish -- enforcing bot auto-reviewers to be specific people with knowledge in the area
##
## Rules to follow for usage for optimum experience
## - OWNERS files are placed on-demand in sub folders
##     - "options: no_parent_owners: true" is needed to force SMEs in those areas
##     - Should include one of the repo's "labels" that start with `area/`
## - Any folder without an OWNERS file works up until it finds one and uses that information
## - Update any of the appovers & reviewers of your area as you see fit (seek managerial feedback if needed)
## - Removal of users from approval areas is rarely necessary -- these are not scrum based, they are knowledge based

aliases:
  # If we need to override sub folders or temporarily grant access to the general approvers
