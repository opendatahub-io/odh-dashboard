# 0001 - Record Architecture Decisions

* Date: 2025-07-25
* Authors: Matias Schimuneck

## Context and Problem Statement

The Gen AI is a complex system with multiple components (BFF, frontend, integrations) that requires careful architectural decisions. As the project evolves, we need a way to:

- Document significant architectural decisions and their rationale
- Provide context for future contributors about why certain choices were made
- Create a knowledge base of design decisions that can be referenced
- Ensure architectural decisions are reviewed and discussed openly

Without proper documentation of architectural decisions, teams often:
- Repeat the same discussions
- Make inconsistent decisions
- Lose context about why decisions were made
- Struggle to onboard new team members

## Decision Drivers

* Need for transparent decision-making process
* Requirement to maintain architectural consistency
* Need to onboard new contributors effectively
* Desire to avoid repeating architectural discussions
* Requirement for reviewable architectural decisions

## Considered Options

* No formal documentation (status quo)
* Architecture documents in wiki/confluence
* Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in version control
* Design documents in separate repository
* Inline code comments for architectural decisions

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) in version control", because:

- ADRs are lightweight and developer-friendly
- Version control ensures decisions are tied to code changes
- ADRs provide a standard format for decision documentation
- They can be reviewed through the same PR process as code
- They create a searchable history of decisions
- They integrate well with development workflow

### Positive Consequences

* Architectural decisions are documented and searchable
* New contributors can understand the reasoning behind design choices
* Decisions can be reviewed and discussed through PRs
* Creates institutional knowledge that persists beyond individual contributors
* Encourages thoughtful architectural decision-making

### Negative Consequences

* Requires discipline to maintain ADRs for significant decisions
* Additional overhead in the development process
* Risk of ADRs becoming outdated if not maintained

## Implementation

1. Create `docs/adr/` directory in the gen-ai package
2. Use numbered ADRs with descriptive filenames (e.g., `0001-record-architecture-decisions.md`)
3. Include ADR creation in the definition of done for architectural changes
4. Use the provided template for consistency
5. Review ADRs through the standard PR process
