/**
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Experimental API Extensions
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This file contains manually implemented API endpoints that are not yet
 * available in the official Swagger specification provided by the backend.
 *
 * The structure, naming, and typing follow the same conventions as the
 * `swagger-typescript-api` generated clients (HttpClient, RequestParams, etc.)
 * under `src/generated` folder to ensure consistency across the codebase
 * and future compatibility.
 *
 * These endpoints are "experimental" in the sense that they either:
 * - Reflect endpoints that exist but are not documented in the Swagger spec.
 * - Represent planned or internal APIs not yet formalized by the backend.
 *
 * Once the backend Swagger specification includes these endpoints, code in this
 * file should be removed, and the corresponding generated modules should be
 * used instead.
 */

// NOTE: All available endpoints are already implemented in the generated code.
