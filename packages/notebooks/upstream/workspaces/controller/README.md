# Kubeflow Workspace Controller
The Kubeflow Workspace Controller is responsible for reconciling the `Workspace` and `WorkspaceKind` resources used in [Kubeflow Notebooks 2.0](https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/7156).

> ⚠️ __Warning__ ⚠️
>
> The Kubeflow Workspace Controller is a work in progress and is __NOT__ currently ready for use.
> We greatly appreciate any contributions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster
**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/workspaces-controller:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands don’t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh

```

privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the manifests/kustomize/samples:

```sh
