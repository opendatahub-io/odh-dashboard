  Use when labeling an issue or pull request based on its content and the
  repository's label conventions, or when delegated to by the review or
  triage agent. Discover repository labels and recommend contextual labels
  to add or remove on issues and pull requests. Produces label_actions in
  the agent result JSON.

# Issue Labels

Recommend contextual labels for the issue or pull request being processed.
These are labels that describe the domain, area, priority, or other
team-specific dimensions -- NOT control labels used by agent pipelines.

Control labels are managed by each agent's post-script and will be refused
server-side if recommended. You do not need to track which labels are
control labels -- just recommend what fits and the pipeline will filter.

## Step 1: Discover available labels

```
gh label list --repo OWNER/REPO --json name,description --limit 100
```

If the repo has no labels beyond those used by agent pipelines, skip labeling
entirely -- do not emit `label_actions`.

## Step 2: Check for GitHub issue types

GitHub issue types (Bug, Feature, Task, etc.) classify issues at a higher level
than labels. **Skip this step when labeling a pull request** -- GitHub issue
types do not apply to PRs.

If the repo uses issue types, do **not** recommend labels that
duplicate the issue type -- e.g., do not add `bug` or `type/bug` when the issue
already has the Bug type.

Query the current issue to check for an issue type:
```
gh issue view NUMBER --repo OWNER/REPO --json type
```

If the `.type` field is non-null, the repo uses issue types. In that case:
- Do not recommend labels whose names match or overlap with the issue type
  (e.g., `bug`, `type/bug`, `enhancement`, `feature`, `type/feature`).
- Area, priority, component, and other non-type labels are still appropriate.

## Step 3: Research labeling conventions

Spawn a sub-agent to investigate how labels have been applied to recent issues.
The sub-agent should:

1. Query recent closed and open issues:
   ```
   gh issue list --repo OWNER/REPO --state all --json number,title,labels --limit 50
   ```
2. Analyze which labels appear together and in what contexts.
3. Return a short summary (under 500 characters) describing the labeling
   conventions observed -- which labels are commonly used and any patterns in
   how they are applied.

Do not dump raw issue data into the parent context. Only use the sub-agent's
summary to inform your recommendations.

## Step 4: Recommend labels

Based on the content, the available labels, and the observed conventions:

- Recommend labels to **add** if they clearly apply.
- Recommend labels to **remove** if stale labels from a prior run no longer
  apply.
- If no labels clearly apply, do not emit `label_actions` at all. Silence is
  better than noise.
- Only recommend labels that exist in `gh label list`. Do not invent labels.

## Output

Include your recommendations in the `label_actions` field of the agent result
JSON:

```json
"label_actions": {
  "reason": "Single sentence explaining the label choices for the whole batch.",
  "actions": [
    { "action": "add", "label": "area/api" },
    { "action": "remove", "label": "area/cli" }
  ]
}
```

Write one concise sentence for `reason` that justifies the batch. Do not
include label justifications in the `comment` field -- the pipeline appends the
reason automatically.
