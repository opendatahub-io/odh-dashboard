[Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/ai-analytics-toolkit.html#gs.2zxkin) - Achieve End-to-End Performance for Data Science and AI Workloads


## Accelerate Data Science & AI Pipelines

The Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit gives data scientists, AI developers, and researchers familiar Python* tools and frameworks to accelerate end-to-end data science and machine learning pipelines on Intel® architectures. The components are built using oneAPI libraries for low-level compute optimizations. This toolkit maximizes performance from preprocessing through machine and deep learning phases and provides interoperability for efficient model development and deployment across single and multinodes.

Using this toolkit, you can:

- Deliver high-performance deep learning (DL) training and inference on Intel® XPUs with Intel-optimized DL frameworks: TensorFlow* and PyTorch*, pretrained models, and Intel Low Precision Optimization Tool. 
- Achieve drop-in acceleration for data preprocessing and machine learning workflows with compute-intensive Python packages: Modin*, scikit-learn*, and XGBoost* optimized for Intel.
- Gain direct access to Intel analytics and AI optimizations to ensure that your software works together seamlessly.


## Installing AI Kit

Intel® oneAPI AI Analytics Toolkit libraries are provided through Anaconda* and can be installed from many existing notebook container images. Intel provides a number of certified container images on RedHat OpenShift DataScience pre-installed JupyterHub that have toolkit components pre-installed, and ready to use. 

Try out selecting the “intel-aikit-notebook:v/0.0.1” JupyterHub Notebook image in JupyterHub to get started!
