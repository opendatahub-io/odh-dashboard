# Red Hat OpenShift API Management

Red Hat OpenShift API Management, when added to managed Red Hat OpenShift, provides a streamlined developer experience for building, deploying, and scaling cloud-native, integrated applications. The combination of enterprise-grade Kubernetes, an API-first approach to integration, and managed operations allows teams to focus on core competencies, accelerate time-to-value, and reduce operational costs.

Red Hat OpenShift API Management makes it easy to secure, share, and control access to services, applications, and enterprise systems across public and private clouds. As a key component in an open, modern approach to building microservices-based applications, it allows organizations to efficiently update and reuse assets, remain agile, and stay ahead of the competition.
