  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to create an ML Pipeline.
    Open Data Hub lets you run Kubeflow or Tekton Pipelines in a scalable OpenShift hybrid cloud environment.

    This quickstart shows you how to compile, create and run a simple example pipeline execution using the Kubeflow Pipelines Python SDK and ML Pipelines UI.

        ### To find the ML Pipelines Launch action:
        1. Click **Applications** &#x2192; **Enabled**.
        2. Find the ML Pipelines card.
        3. Click **Launch** on the ML Pipelines card to access the **Piplines dashboard**.

        A new browser tab will open displaying the **Pipelines Dashboard** page.

        ### Install the Kubeflow Pipelines Python SDK
        1. Follow the [Kubeflow Pipelines Tekton Python SDK Installation instructions](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton/blob/master/samples/README.md#prerequisites)
        2. Download, clone or copy the [flip-coin example pipeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/blob/master/samples/core/condition/condition.py)
        3. Compile the python pipeline defintion into a Tekton YAML:
        ```
        python condition.py
        ```

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify you compiled the flip-coin sample pipeline:
          Is there now a `condition.yaml` file in the directory you downloaded `condition.py` from?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have installed the Kubeflow Pipelines Tekton SDK and compiled a sample pipeline definition into a Tekton yaml
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Create a Pipeline
      description: |-
        ### Create a simple Pipeline from an example Kubeflow Pipeline .py file:
        1. Click the **+Upload Pipeline** button in the top right corner
        2. Leave the **Create a new pipeline** radio button selected
        3. Type a pipeline name in the **Pipeline Name** field
        4. Add a short description in the **Pipeline Description** field
        5. Select the **Upload a file** radio button and click **Choose file** in the **File** text box
        6. Find and select the condition.yaml file you compiled from the previous step
        7. Click **Create**

        The ML Pipelines **Upload Pipeline** page will redirect to a graph of the Pipeline you created

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify that you have created a Pipeline:
          Do you see a graph/chart in the shape of a flow diagram, that is titled with your sample pipeline's name?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully created an ML Pipeline.
        failed: Try the steps again.

    - title: Run the Pipeline
      description: |-
        ### Create the pipeline created in the previous setp:
        1. Click the **+ Create run** button in the top right corner. You will be redirected to a **Start a run** form.
        2. Click the **Choose** button in the **Experiment** text field.  Select the **Default** experiment.
        3. Leave all other fields the same.
        4. Click the **Start** button.

        You will now be redirected to the **Default** Experiment page.  You should see an execution of the pipeline you created in the **Active** list of runs.

        instructions: |-
          #### To verify that you have executed a Pipeline run:
          Are you on the **Experiments** page of the ML Pipelines UI?  Do you see an entry under **Active** runs with the name of the pipeline you created?
        failedTaskHelp: This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully run an ML Pipeline.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to create and run a sample ML Pipeline!
