  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to launch a SKLearn model and use canary deployment practices to update the model.
    Seldon Deploy is a specialist set of tools designed to simplify and accelerate the process of deploying and managing your machine learning models.

    This quick start is a short version of the Seldon [Canary Promotion](https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/canary/) tutorial.

        ### Deploy a pretrained SKLearn iris model
        1. Open Seldon Console and click **Create** to open the deployment creation wizard.
        2. Select the **SeldonDeployment** type and click **Next**.
        3. Choose the **scikit-learn** runtime. Enter the model URL: `gs://seldon-models/sklearn/iris`
        4. Click through wizard to deploy the model.
      summary:
        success: You have deployed a pretrained SKLearn iris model
        failed: Try the steps again or see the Seldon [Canary Promotion](https://deploy.seldon.io/docs/demos/seldon-core/canary/) tutorial
    - title: Start load test
      description: |-
        ### Complete the load test wizard:
        1. Use this request payload to make a prediction:
        ```
        {"data": {"names": ["Sepal length","Sepal width","Petal length","Petal Width"], "ndarray": [[6.8,  2.8,  4.8,  1.4], [6.0,  3.4,  4.5,  1.6]]}}
        ```
        2. When running you should see metrics on dashboard. Enter the request logs screen to view request payloads.
      summary:
        success: You successfully performed a load test against the pre-trained Iris model.
        failed: Try the steps again.
    - title: Create the canary model
      description: |-
        ### Create and promote an XGBoost canary model
        1. Create an XGBoost canary model using the saved model at `gs://seldon-models/xgboost/iris`.
        2. Rerun the load test and you should see metrics for both default and canary models.
        3. Promote the XGBoost Canary to be the main model.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully promoted the XGBoost to be the canary model.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to promote a model.
