  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start shows you how to create an Anaconda-enabled Jupyter notebook.
    Red Hat® OpenShift® Data Science lets you run Jupyter notebooks on our Red Hat® OpenShift Dedicated environment.

    With Anaconda Commercial edition you can access and use Anaconda packages that are curated for security and compatibility.

    This quick start will get you working in a notebook in just a few minutes.

    - title: Ensure you are subscribed to use Anaconda Commercial Edition packages.
      description: |-
        ### To verify that you are subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition in the notebook, follow these steps:
        1. In a notebook cell, type and run `!conda token set $ANACONDA_TOKEN` (replacing $ANACONDA_TOKEN with your own Anaconda Commercial Edition token.)
        1. Run `!conda info` in a notebook cell.

        instructions: |-
          #### Verify that your Anaconda package manager points to the right repositories
          Do the repositories in `conda info` point to `repo.anaconda.cloud` instead of `repo.anaconda.com`?
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task is not verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have successfully subscribed to Anaconda Commercial Edition.
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You are now able to install Anaconda Commercial Edition packages within your Jupyter notebook using the command `conda install $PACKAGE`.  If you want to learn how to deploy a model, take the next quick start.
