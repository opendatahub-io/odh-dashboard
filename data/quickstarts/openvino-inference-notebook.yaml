  introduction: |-
    ### This quick start details how to quantize a model and use the result for inference from a notebook using the OpenVINO toolkit.

    The OpenVINO toolkit model optimizer can create lower precision intermediate representations of machine learning models.

    Using the resulting intermediate representations can reduce the time required to perform an inference operation while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

    This quick start will walk through how to optimize a ONNX computer vision model using the OpenVINO model optimizer, and use the resulting intermediate representation to perform hardware accelerated inference in-notebook.

        ### Loading the OpenVINO notebook
        1. Download the "pytorch_onnx_openvino.ipynb" notebook from the [OpenVINO Notebooks repository](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/openvino_notebooks).
        2. Upload notebook file "pytorch_onnx_openvino.ipynb" using notebook server file manager.
        3. Click on the uploaded notebook to launch it in a new browser tab.

          #### Verify that the notebook launched successfully
          Do you have a notebook tab for the OpenVINO notebook in your browser?
        failedTaskHelp:
          This task isn’t verified yet. Try the task again.
      summary:
        success: You have loaded the example notebook
        failed: Try the steps again.
  conclusion: You can complete the rest of the quick start inside the notebook itself. Proceed cell by cell, taking care not to skip any. Once you have completed the entire notebook, you will have been exposed to several OpenVINO toolkit fundamentals.
