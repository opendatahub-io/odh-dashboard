## Contributing

Individual bug fixes are welcome, it is recommended that you create a bug [issue] at the same time to describe the fix you're applying. If you are unsure how best to solve it, start with the issue and note your desire to contribute.

Large feature implementations will need to go through our internal [definition of ready] to make sure we align with the wider architectural design. 

To start a conversation on implementing a feature for the Dashboard, open up a feature request [issue].

We also have some [contributing guidelines] you can follow.
