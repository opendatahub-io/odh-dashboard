## Deploying the ODH Dashbard

### Official Image Builds

odh-dashboard images are automatically built and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/opendatahub/odh-dashboard) after every commit to the `main` branch. The image tag name format for each image is `main-<COMMIT SHORT HASH>`.

Example: The `main` branch is updated with commit `f76e3952834f453b1d085e8627f9c17297c2f64c`.  The CI system will automatically build an odh-dashboard image based on that code and push the new image to `odh-dashboard:main-f76e395` and updated `odh-dashboard:main` to point to the same image hash.

The [nightly](https://quay.io/opendatahub/odh-dashboard:nightly) tag is a floating tag that is updated nightly and points to the most recent `main-<HASH>` commit from the previous day.

### Deploy using kustomize

The [manifests](./manifests) folder contains a [kustomize](https://kustomize.io) manifest that can be used with `kustomize build`.

### Deploy using a kfdef

The [manifests/kfdef](./manifests/kfdef) folder contains an example kfdef to deploy ODH Dashboard with the Notebook Controller backend is located in [odh-dashboard-kfnbc-test.yaml](manifests/kfdef/odh-dashboard-kfnbc-test.yaml).
