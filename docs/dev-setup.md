# Dev Setup

## Requirements

ODH requires the following to run:

- [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/)
  - Node recommended version -> `18.18.2`
  - NPM recommended version -> `9.8.1`
- [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.16/html/cli_tools/openshift-cli-oc)
- [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize) (if you need to do deployment)

### Additional tooling

- [Podman](https://github.com/containers/podman)
- [Quay.io](https://quay.io/)

## Development

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/opendatahub-io/odh-dashboard
   ```
2. Within the repo context, we use `npm` to install project dependencies
   ```bash
   cd odh-dashboard && npm install
   ```

### Build project

```bash
npm run build
```

### Serve development content

This is the default context for running a local UI. Make sure you build the project using the instructions above prior to running the command below.

> Note: You must be logged-in with `oc` before you can start the backend. Details for that are in the the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md#give-your-dev-env-access).

> Note: The CLI logged-in user will need to be a `cluster-admin` level user on the cluster to mimic the Dashboard Service Account level of permissions. You could also bind the [cluster role](../manifests/core-bases/base/cluster-role.yaml) to your user as we do with the service account [binding](../manifests/core-bases/base/cluster-role-binding.yaml).

```bash
npm run start
```

> If you'd like to run "backend" and "frontend" separately for development, cd into each directory in two different terminals and run `npm run start:dev` from each.

For in-depth local run guidance review the [contribution guidelines](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Testing
Run the tests.

```bash
npm run test
```

For in-depth testing guidance review the [testing guidelines](./testing.md)

### Dev Feature Flags

Feature flags are defined in the [dashboard config](./dashboard-config.md#features). When testing on a live cluster, changing feature flags via the config affects all users on the cluster. It is also possible to personally control the enablement of feature flags within the browser session. Simply append `?devFeatureFlags` to the dashboard URL. A blue banner will appear at the top of the page where a modal can be opened, allowing one to adjust the enablement of feature flags. These settings will persist for the length of the browser session.

With the dev feature flags modal opened, the browser URL will update to include the current feature flag enablement settings. The URL can then be bookmarked or shared.

### Configuring Custom Console Link Domain (CONSOLE_LINK_DOMAIN)

Certain environments require custom access configurations for the OpenShift console and Prometheus endpoints because they may not have access to internal services. To support these configurations, the CONSOLE_LINK_DOMAIN environment variable allows developers to specify a custom domain to override default calculations.

Steps to Configure:

1.  Open the root `.env.local` file (or create it if it doesn't exist).
2.  Add the following line to define the custom console domain:

    <code>CONSOLE_LINK_DOMAIN=your-custom-domain.com</code>

Replace your-custom-domain.com with the specific domain for your OpenShift console

## Deploying the ODH Dashbard

### Official Image Builds

odh-dashboard images are automatically built and pushed to [quay.io](https://quay.io/repository/opendatahub/odh-dashboard) after every commit to the `main` branch. The image tag name format for each image is `main-<COMMIT SHORT HASH>`.

Example: The `main` branch is updated with commit `f76e3952834f453b1d085e8627f9c17297c2f64c`. The CI system will automatically build an odh-dashboard image based on that code and push the new image to `odh-dashboard:main-f76e395` and updated `odh-dashboard:main` to point to the same image hash.

The [nightly](https://quay.io/opendatahub/odh-dashboard:nightly) tag is a floating tag that is updated nightly and points to the most recent `main-<HASH>` commit from the previous day.

### Deploy using kustomize

The [manifests](./manifests) folder contains a [kustomize](https://kustomize.io) manifest that can be used with `kustomize build`.

### Deploy using a kfdef

> Note: This flow is deprecated, deploy v2 [Operator](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/opendatahub-operator) with their custom CR.

The [manifests/kfdef](./manifests/kfdef) folder contains an example kfdef to deploy ODH Dashboard with the Notebook Controller backend is located in [odh-dashboard-kfnbc-test.yaml](manifests/kfdef/odh-dashboard-kfnbc-test.yaml).
